Abstract:

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by enabling predictive analytics and precision medicine, shifting the focus from reactive to proactive care. Synthetic data, generated using machine learning algorithms, is a promising solution for data-scarce scenarios. This report explores the impact of synthetic data in healthcare, its benefits, limitations, and the challenges associated with it. Synthetic data can be used for drug discovery, medical imaging, clinical trials, genetic sequencing, and medical research. Synthetic data can also be used for privacy-preserving data sharing, reducing the need for sensitive data and invasive procedures. However, synthetic data raises concerns about data ownership, privacy, confidentiality, accuracy, and quality.

Introduction:

The use of synthetic data in healthcare is gaining significant attention due to the reliability and trustworthiness of the underlying data being heavily dependent on the stages preceding the model development, namely data extraction from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Synthetic data is generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that learn the distribution of real-world data, reducing the need for sensitive patient data. Synthetic data can be used for various applications such as drug discovery, medical imaging, and clinical trials. Synthetic data can be used for privacy-preserving data sharing, reducing the need for labeled data, reducing the cost and time required for clinical trials. Synthetic data can also be used for genetic sequencing, reducing the need for radiation exposure and invasive procedures. This report explores the benefits, limitations, and challenges of synthetic data in healthcare.

Benefits:

1. Synthetic data can be used to augment the training set size, improving model accuracy and reducing overfitting.
2. Synthetic data can be used to generate synthetic patient cohorts for rare diseases, which are underrepresented in real-world data.
3. Synthetic data can be used to generate synthetic images for medical imaging, reducing the need for labeled data.
4. Synthetic data can be used to generate synthetic genomes, reducing the need for genetic sequencing. 5. Synthetic data can be used to generate synthetic CT scans, reducing radiation exposure to patients.

Ethical Challenges:

1. Synthetic data raises concerns about data ownership and intellectual property rights.
2. Synthetic data raises concerns about data privacy and confidentiality. 3. Synthetic data raises concerns about data accuracy and security.

Technical Challenges:

1. Synthetic data can be used for model validation, raising concerns about accuracy. 2. Synthetic data can be used to generate synthetic CT scans, raising concerns about quality and resolution.

Discussion:

Synthetic data is a promising solution for data-scarce scenarios in healthcare. Synthetic data can be used for drug discovery, medical imaging, and clinical trials, reducing the need for sensitive patient data. Synthetic data can also be used for privacy-preserving data sharing, reducing the need for labeled data, reducing the cost and time required for clinical trials. Synthetic data can also be used for genetic sequencing, reducing the need for radiation exposure and invasive procedures. However, synthetic data raises concerns about data ownership, privacy, confidentiality, accuracy, and quality. Synthetic data can be used for model validation, raising concerns about accuracy and resolution.
